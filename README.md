# colecovision
Modification of ColecoVision Mister Core to be able to use DDR3 RAM or SDRAM module on a Terasic DE10 nano. This was an HDL training exercise while waiting 
for the arrival of my SDRAM module. Some parts were ported from VHDL to System Verilog.

The way to do it was adapted from the Sega Genesis core.

Thanks to the ATLAS board members (Antonio SÃ¡nchez) for clarifying the use of the Z80 wait signal.

I am pleased to announce the formation of an FPGA Low Latency Trading Development Group. We welcome interested individuals to connect and collaborate with us.
